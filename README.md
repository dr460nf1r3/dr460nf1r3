<h2 align="center">Hey stranger 👋, I'm Nico!</h2>
<h3 align="center">I am an avid Linux enthusiast and hobby developer from Germany 🇩🇪</h3>

After having found a deep passion for Linux and all kind of FOSS projects, I'm now active as:
- Developer at [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org). Here, I'm mostly maintaining the servers & some of its editions. I also take care of a lot of other stuff that needs to be done. If you love dark and blurry interfaces, the dr460nized edition might be something for you! 🐉 This is also the setup I use on my personal machines.

- Maintainer of [Chaotic-AUR](https://chaotic.cx), an Arch user repository which also happens to be the repo of Garuda Linux. It can be used to prevent long compilation times of AUR packages that can take hours to complete. Since most packages are getting rebuilt hourly if updates are found, it is very easy to get always the latest packages and follow development processes.

- Maintainer of [Firedragon](https://github.com/dr460nf1r3/firedragon-browser), a Librewolf fork which focuses on providing better KDE integration and saner default settings. Since I'm a huge fan of selfhosting services, it integrates some of our hosted services such as our own Firefox syncserver, searX and Whoogle.
